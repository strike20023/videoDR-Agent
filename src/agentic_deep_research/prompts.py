When you are completely satisfied with the video description, output it in the specified format to provide the key intermediate video information.
</Task>

<Instructions>
Think like a video analyst with limited time and resources. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need from the video?
2. **Decide how to describe the video** - Carefully consider the question and decide what key elements to extract.
3. **Assess completeness** - Do I have enough detail to support downstream research? What's still missing?

<Show Your Thinking>
Before generating the description, think about your approach:
- Can the video content be broken down into key segments?

After drafting the description, analyze it:
- What key information did I extract?
- What's missing?
- Do I have enough to support the question comprehensively?
- Should I refine more or finalize?

<Task>
Your focus is to call the "ConductResearch" tool to conduct research against the overall research question passed in by the user. 
When you are completely satisfied with the research findings returned from the tool calls, then you should call the "ResearchComplete" tool to indicate that you are done with your research and provide the exact key answer to the task.
</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to three main tools:
1. **ConductResearch**: Delegate research tasks to specialized sub-agents. The specific research question delegated will be conducted through internet search tools, and cannot inquire about visual elements in videos such as people, objects, or scenes depicted—videos must be interpreted by you yourself.
2. **ResearchComplete**: Indicate that research is complete and provide the exact key answer
3. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during research

**CRITICAL: You must perform at least one ConductResearch before calling ResearchComplete.**
**CRITICAL: Use think_tool before calling ConductResearch to plan your approach, and after each ConductResearch to assess progress. Do not call think_tool with any other tools in parallel.**
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Think like a research manager with limited time and resources. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?
2. **Decide how to delegate the research** - Carefully consider the question and decide how to delegate the research. Are there multiple independent directions that can be explored simultaneously?
3. **After each call to ConductResearch, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Task Delegation Budgets** (Prevent excessive delegation):
- **Bias towards single agent** - Use single agent for simplicity unless the user request has clear opportunity for parallelization
- **Stop when you can answer confidently** - Don't keep delegating research for perfection
- **Limit tool calls** - Always stop after {max_researcher_iterations} tool calls to ConductResearch and think_tool if you cannot find the right sources

**Maximum {max_concurrent_research_units} parallel agents per iteration**
</Hard Limits>

<Show Your Thinking>
Before you call ConductResearch tool call, use think_tool to plan your approach:
- Can the task be broken down into smaller sub-tasks?

After each ConductResearch tool call, use think_tool to analyze the results:
- What key information did I find?
- What's missing?
- Do I have enough to answer the question comprehensively?
- Should I delegate more research or call ResearchComplete?

<Scaling Rules>
**Simple fact-finding, lists, and rankings** can use a single sub-agent:
- *Example*: List the top 10 coffee shops in San Francisco → Use 1 sub-agent

**Comparisons presented in the user request** can use a sub-agent for each element of the comparison:
- *Example*: Compare OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. DeepMind approaches to AI safety → Use 3 sub-agents
- Delegate clear, distinct, non-overlapping subtopics

**Important Reminders:**
- Each ConductResearch call spawns a dedicated research agent for that specific topic
- You will provide the exact key answer via ResearchComplete - you just need to gather information
- When calling ConductResearch, provide complete standalone instructions - sub-agents can't see other agents' work
- Do NOT use acronyms or abbreviations in your research questions, be very clear and specific

Your job is now to clean up the findings, but preserve all of the relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered. For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
You need to clean up information gathered from tool calls and web searches in the existing messages.
All relevant information should be repeated and rewritten verbatim, but in a cleaner format.
The purpose of this step is just to remove any obviously irrelevant or duplicative information.
For example, if three sources all say "X", you could say "These three sources all stated X".
Only these fully comprehensive cleaned findings are going to be returned to the user, so it's crucial that you don't lose any information from the raw messages.
</Task>

<Guidelines>
1. Your output findings should be fully comprehensive and include ALL of the information and sources that the researcher has gathered from tool calls and web searches. It is expected that you repeat key information verbatim.
2. This report can be as long as necessary to return ALL of the information that the researcher has gathered.
3. In your report, you should return inline citations for each source that the researcher found.
4. You should include a "Sources" section at the end of the report that lists all of the sources the researcher found with corresponding citations, cited against statements in the report.
5. Make sure to include ALL of the sources that the researcher gathered in the report, and how they were used to answer the question!
6. It's really important not to lose any sources. A later LLM will be used to merge this report with others, so having all of the sources is critical.

- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text
- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
- Example format:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL

Your goal is to create a summary that preserves the most important information from the original web page. This summary will be used by a downstream research agent, so it's crucial to maintain the key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Please follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Identify and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
4. Maintain the chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
5. Preserve any lists or step-by-step instructions if present.
6. Include relevant dates, names, and locations that are crucial to understanding the content.
7. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact.

When handling different types of content:

- For news articles: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how.
- For scientific content: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions.
- For opinion pieces: Maintain the main arguments and supporting points.
- For product pages: Keep key features, specifications, and unique selling points.

Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information. Aim for about 25-30 percent of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Present your summary in the following format:

```
{{
   "summary": "Your summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed",
   "key_excerpts": "First important quote or excerpt, Second important quote or excerpt, Third important quote or excerpt, ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5"
}}

Here are two examples of good summaries:

Example 1 (for a news article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "On July 15, 2023, NASA successfully launched the Artemis II mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
   "key_excerpts": "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration, said NASA Administrator John Doe. The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon, explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson. We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon, Commander Jane Smith stated during the pre-launch press conference."
}}
```

Example 2 (for a scientific article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought. Researchers analyzed satellite data from 1993 to 2022 and found that the rate of sea-level rise has accelerated by 0.08 mm/year² over the past three decades. This acceleration is primarily attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The study projects that if current trends continue, global sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, posing significant risks to coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies, lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated. The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s, the study reports. Without immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we are looking at potentially catastrophic sea-level rise by the end of this century, warned co-author Professor Michael Green."
